## Featured Projects üíª

### [Kipu Health](https://www.kipuhealth.com/)

- I was part of a dynamic team responsible for developing and maintaining a Behavioral Healthcare System Ruby on Rails.
- The Kipu ecosystem is transforming the behavioral health business with an industry-leading suite of products. Kipu helps treatment centers achieve optimal outcomes and empowers patients and caregivers at every step of the recovery journey.
- My responsibilities include:

### [Public Health Management System](https://om30.com.br/saude-simples/)

- I was part of a dynamic team responsible for developing and maintaining a Health System for Public Health Management System using Ruby on Rails, ElasticSearch, and Vue.js.
- We integrated the system with the Brazilian SUS regulations, ensuring compliance and contributing to the project's focus on effective healthcare administration.

### [Storyboard](https://new.trystoryboard.com/)

- I was part of a dynamic team responsible for developing and maintaining a web application for private podcasts hosted on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform;
- This application was built using the Ruby on Rails framework, a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture that allowed for efficient development and scalability.
- One of the key components of the application's architecture was the use of Redis as a caching and queuing system. Redis was employed to store scheduled jobs for various tasks within the application, enhancing its performance and responsiveness. This ensured critical processes, such as background jobs and data caching, were executed smoothly and efficiently. Additionally, the application's data was stored and managed in a PostgreSQL database, providing a robust and reliable data storage and retrieval foundation.
- The web application was crafted using a combination of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. JavaScript enhanced interactivity and provided a seamless user experience, while CSS and Bootstrap ensured a visually appealing and responsive design.

### [FundsExplorer](https://www.fundsexplorer.com.br/)

- I created a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to aggregate data from real estate investment funds (FIIs) traded on the Brazilian stock exchange, B3.
This project addressed the need for a centralized and user-friendly platform to access scattered financial information related to these funds. Leveraging the Ruby on Rails framework, we created a robust and scalable application that streamlined data collection and presentation.
- The heart of this application lies in its database infrastructure, powered by PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL provided a reliable and high-performance foundation for storing and organizing the vast amounts of financial data collected from multiple sources. The relational nature of PostgreSQL allowed for complex queries and data relationships to be efficiently managed, ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for users.
- The web application was crafted using a combination of JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Bootstrap. JavaScript was employed to enhance interactivity and provide a seamless user experience, while CSS and Bootstrap ensured a visually appealing and responsive design. HTML was used for structuring the content and ensuring accessibility standards were met.
- To bring this MVP to production, we opted for Heroku as our hosting platform. Heroku's ease of use and seamless deployment workflow simplified the transition from development to a live, accessible application. It also provided scalability options to accommodate potential increases in user traffic, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.
The outcome was a user-friendly and production-ready platform, now utilized by over 300,000 investors and financial professionals, enabling them to access real-time data on Brazilian FIIs conveniently.


### [CopyFolio](https://www.copyfolio.com.br/)

- We developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a portfolio creation platform tailored to the needs of writers. This project involved the utilization of React and Next.js, harnessing the power of these frameworks to create a responsive and highly interactive user interface.
- We designed and integrated the backend using Node.js and MongoDB as the primary database. The NoSQL nature of MongoDB allowed us to adapt to changing data structures as the project evolved, ensuring optimal performance and data organization.
- We leveraged Vercel, a platform known for its simplicity and speed in deploying web applications. This choice streamlined the deployment process, allowing us to take the MVP from development to production swiftly.
